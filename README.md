# Learning helps us to be present to the world around us

- 👋 Hi, I’m @dleninja, you can call me Dave. There is an AI revolution on the horizon and I'm happy to be a part of it!
- 👀 I’m interested in image processing and the application of artificial intelligence for biomedical imaging.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects related to the classification of retinal diseases (retinopathy) and segmentation of retinal vessels in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).
